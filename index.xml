      <description>Context Recently my primary workstation failed due to a motherboard issue. I needed to quickly get my development environment setup on another machine. Here are the steps I followed to clone my machine using rsync. Before moving on to that, Let me explain a little about rsync, In layman&amp;rsquo;s terms rsync is a utility for efficiently transferring and synchronizing files between a computer and an external disk, it does this by sending only the differences in the data to the destination rather than resending the whole file every time there is an update.</description>

      <description>Little SVG history Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is an XML-based vector image format for two-dimensional graphics with support for interactivity and animation. The SVG specification is an open standard developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) in 1999. SVG images are defined in a vector graphics format and stored in XML text files. SVG images can thus be scaled in size without loss of quality, and SVG files can be searched, indexed, scripted, and compressed.</description>

      <description>This is a written version of the talk I presented to my colleagues. This is a basic introduction to asynchronous programming in django.

The effort for implementing async support in django was done by Andrew Godwin üëè Now let&amp;rsquo;s look into how this async django works&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>So this blog is my personal opinion on the recent ban of apps in India, Due to the border conflicts with China. Openly say I am against this ban, but rather than ban people must aware of the consequences of using such closed-source apps. And people must aware that not only apps in this list raise security issues said by the Government, all those closed source apps out there raises different kind of security and privacy issues for us as an individual</description>

 server management database management backups hosting/bandwidth/scalability/users  And I have found a solution for all this, for server management, we can choose some hosting services like GitHub/Gitlab pages or Netfly.</description>
