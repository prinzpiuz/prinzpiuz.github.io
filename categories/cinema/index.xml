      <description>Rating: Aavesham Movie is directed and written by Jithu Madhavan, known for &amp;ldquo;Romancham&amp;rdquo;. Aavesham reintroduces Fafa as Ranga, a local gangster from Bengaluru. The movie follows three teenagers as they meet Ranga and their lives afterwards.&#xA;What I Liked About the Movie It&amp;rsquo;s all about performance. Fafa&amp;rsquo;s acting was unique when he simply exploded as Ranga. No one in the movie could match FaFa&amp;rsquo;s energy and vibrant performance.&#xA;I really enjoyed watching this movie!</description>

      <description>Rating: This is my first movie review. After watching this film, I felt compelled to share my thoughts. His cinema surpasses the standards of not only Malayalam but Indian cinema as well.&#xA;The film Aadujeevitham is based on a novel of the same name by author Benyamin. The story is inspired by a true incident from the life of a man named Najeeb, who hails from a small village in Kerala, India.</description>
