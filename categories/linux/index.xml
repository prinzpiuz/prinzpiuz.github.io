      <description>The reason I&amp;rsquo;m writing this blog because I learned lot of things while setting up my media server to current configuration, so this is kinda experience sharing, may be useful for those who trying one.
 Little History ðŸ•œ From my teenage itself I&amp;rsquo;m a binge movie watcher, at that time I saves money and buy DVDs of movies I like and I had a small collection of DVDs, then I brought a desktop PC, and it was time of USB sticks and it became little more easy and cheap to collect movies, still somebody need to download movies from torrent (thanks The Pirate Bay) or rip from DVDs,but still network speed was very low then(I had a BSNL bradband connection which had only 512kbps), With the arrival of 4G.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Repetitive task should be automated&amp;rdquo; - somebody, somewhere ðŸ˜Ž
 Its common philosophy in the field of it to automate repetitive tasks, even if it takes some time now to set up it will save a lot of time in the future. In this post, I like to share the kinda experience I had today while updating my machine and how python solved it easily.
In my work machine, I am running Manjaro Linux, which is a Rolling Release based on Archlinux.</description>
