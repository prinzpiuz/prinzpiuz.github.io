 Its common philosophy in field of it to automate repetitive tasks, even if it take some time now to set-up it it will save lot of time in future. In this post I like to share kinda experience i had today while updating my machine and how python solved it easily.
In my work machine I am running Manjaro Linux, which is a Rolling Release based on Archlinux.</description>
